# Best App Winner - Project Overview

## Introduction
This project involves developing a software application that automates the voting process for university students' app development contest. It dynamically manages and processes data through a structured software solution.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Data Management**: Reads and processes data from `input.txt` file and outputs results to `print.txt`.
- **Array Utilization**: Uses single, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional arrays to manage data such as university names, contest dates, participant names, and scores.
- **Command Operations**: Implements commands to add and update data within the system, such as `addUniversity`, `addDates`, and `addScore`.

## Technical Requirements

- **File Handling**: Ensures that the input and output files are managed correctly, matching specified formats and handling errors, such as missing files.
- **Output Formatting**: Generates detailed reports based on the processed data, ensuring the format aligns precisely with specified requirements.

## Objective

To provide a practical experience in handling file I/O operations, applying array data structures, and developing software that meets specific operational requirements. This project showcases the application of fundamental programming concepts in a real-world scenario.

## How to Use

Instructions or examples on how the technologies were applied in the project are provided, focusing on software development skills without involving specific educational or proprietary details.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code examples to meet your own development needs.
